# Deployment

YamlPress is a static site, meaning it can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the creators of Next.js and offers the best integration.

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Run deploy command:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

## Netlify

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `out` directory to Netlify manually or connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for automatic deployments.

## GitHub Pages

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Push the contents of the `out` directory to a `gh-pages` branch.

## Any Static Host

You can deploy the contents of the `out` directory to any web server or CDN (AWS S3, Firebase Hosting, Surge, etc.).
