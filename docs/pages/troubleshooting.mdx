# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions when working with YamlPress.

## Hydration Errors

If you see errors like `Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match...`, it usually means your HTML structure is invalid (e.g., nesting a `div` inside a `p` tag) or you are rendering something dynamic (like a timestamp) on the server that differs from the client.

**Solution:** Use the `useEffect` hook to render dynamic content only on the client side, or verify your HTML nesting.

## Images Not Loading

Ensure your images are placed in the `public` directory and referenced with a leading slash.

- Correct: `/assets/image.png`
- Incorrect: `assets/image.png`

## Styles Not Applying

If Tailwind classes aren't working, check your `tailwind.config.ts` content array to ensure it includes all paths where you are using classes.

```ts
content: [
  './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
  './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
  './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
],
```
