# Advanced Usage

## Custom Scripts

You can add custom scripts to your application by ensuring they are loaded in `app/layout.tsx` or using the Next.js `Script` component.

## Environment Variables

For sensitive information that shouldn't be in `config.yaml`, use `.env.local` files.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## CMS Integration

YamlPress is designed to be extensible. While it primarily uses Markdown files, you can integrate with headless CMSs like Contentful or Sanity by modifying the data fetching logic in `lib/posts.ts`.

## RSS Feed Generation

The project automatically generates an RSS feed at build time. Ensure your `site.base_url` is correctly set in `config.yaml` for valid feed generation.
