# Theming

YamlPress allows extensive theming capabilities through the `config.yaml` file.

## Colors

You can customize the base color palette of your site.

```yaml
theme:
  colors:
    primary: "#1a202c"    # Main brand color
    secondary: "#f6ad55"  # Accent color
    accent: "#4299e1"     # Link and button color
    background_light: "#ffffff"
    background_dark: "#0f172a"
    text_light: "#2d3748"
    text_dark: "#e2e8f0"
```

## Fonts

Customize the typography by specifying font families.

```yaml
theme:
  fonts:
    heading: "Inter, sans-serif"
    body: "Roboto, sans-serif"
```

## Dark Mode

Dark mode is supported out of the box. You can set the default mode in the configuration.

```yaml
theme:
  default_mode: "light" # options: light, dark, system
```
